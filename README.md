# STM32-NFC-TAG-Read-Write-with-UART-Serial-Terminal
The software that enables Read/Write operations in NFC Tag is prepared with the STM32L476RG developer card. The presence of NFC Tags with the embedded software allows reading and writing operations on the Tags. And the data written to the NFC Tag and the time of the written data are recorded in the database. These data can be read or cleared in the interface. In addition, the UART serial terminal interface is developed, which allows monitoring the transactions on the NFC Tag via Python's PyQt5 library.
